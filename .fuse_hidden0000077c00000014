\section{HDTrace ?- A Tracing and Simulation Environment of
Application and System Interaction}

Abstract HDTrace is an environment which allows to
trace and simulate the behavior of MPI programs on a
cluster. It explicitly includes support to trace internals
of MPICH2 and the parallel file system PVFS. With
this support it enables to localize inefficiencies, to conduct research on new algorithms and to evaluate future
systems. Simulation provides upper bounds of expected
performance and helps to assess observed performance
as potential performance gains of optimizations can be
approximated.
In this paper the environment is introduced and
several examples depict how it assists to reveal internal behavior and spot bottlenecks. In an example with
PVFS the inefficient write-out of a matrix diagonal
could be either identified by inspecting the PVFS server
behavior or by simulation. Additionally the simulation
showed that in theory the operation should finish 20
times faster on our cluster ? by applying correct MPI
hints this potential could be exploited.
