\section{HDTrace - A Tracing and Simulation Environment of Application and System Interaction}

HDTrace is an environment which allows to
trace and simulate the behavior of MPI programs on a
cluster. It explicitly includes support to trace internals
of MPICH2 and the parallel file system PVFS. With
this support it enables to localize inefficiencies, to conduct research on new algorithms and to evaluate future
systems. Simulation provides upper bounds of expected
performance and helps to assess observed performance
as potential performance gains of optimizations can be
approximated.

In this paper the environment is introduced and
several examples depict how it assists to reveal internal behavior and spot bottlenecks. In an example with
PVFS the inefficient write-out of a matrix diagonal
could be either identified by inspecting the PVFS server
behavior or by simulation. Additionally the simulation
showed that in theory the operation should finish 20
times faster on our cluster - by applying correct MPI
hints this potential could be exploited.

\section{Towards an Energy-Aware Scientific I/O Interface}

Intelligently switching energy saving modes
of CPUs, NICs and disks is mandatory to reduce the
energy consumption. 

Hardware and operating system have a limited perspective of future performance demands, thus automatic
control is suboptimal. However, it is tedious for a developer to control the hardware by himself.

In this paper we propose an extension of an existing I/O interface which on the one hand is easy to use
and on the other hand could steer energy saving modes
more efficiently. Furthermore, the proposed modifications are beneficial for performance analysis and provide even more information to the I/O library to improve performance.

When a user annotates the program with the proposed interface, I/O, communication and computation
phases are labeled by the developer. Run-time behavior is then characterized for each phase, this knowledge
could be then exploited by the new library.
